(project is under work)

Created own dataset by scraping twitter data. scraping users
 tweets & classified depression using machine learning algorithms .


Created a project "Depression Detection Using Machine learning" where i created own dataset from Twitter (this can collect unlimited data), and done many preprocessing, cleaning, data analysis, feature extraction steps on dataset and applied various classifiers and compared the to find the best classifier with higher accuracy. 
And after that we have to give the username of Twitter user so the program will collect all tweets and from collected data it will classify that the user is depressed or not.
